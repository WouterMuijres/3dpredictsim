IG (Initial Guesses)
====================

Folder with the scripts setting the initial guesses of the optimal control problems.

1. getGuess_QR_v2.m
    - Script that describes the quasi-random initial guess.
1. getGuess_QR.m
    - Script that describes the quasi-random initial guess. This script was used to generate the results of the [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2019.0402). This script is no longer used in newer developments so that users can fully replicate our results. For a newer version of the code, please use getGuess_QR_v2.m.
2. getGuess_QR_prosthesis.m
    - Script that describes the quasi-random initial guess for the prosthesis case.
3. getGuess_DI_v2.m
    - Script that describes the data-informed initial guess.
3. getGuess_DI.m
    - Script that describes the data-informed initial guess. This script was used to generate the results of the [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2019.0402). This script is no longer used in newer developments so that users can fully replicate our results. For a newer version of the code, please use getGuess_QR_v2.m.
4. getGuess_DI_prosthesis.m
    - Script that describes the data-informed initial guess for the prosthesis case.
5. getGuess_DI_t.m
    - Script that describes the data-informed initial guess with the final time based on provided data.
6. getGuess_DI_tracking.m
    - Script that describes the data-informed initial guess for the tracking simulation.
